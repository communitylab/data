    "In this section we introduce Python programming and present examples illustrating key language features. We can learn the syntax of `Python` in a few days, but learning to use a language is more than just learning the syntax. Building a pool of experience that lets us be an efficient programmer is usually tough -- as it requires working on good quality exercises for months, but it is doable and certainly very useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume no prior knowledge of Python, but experience with programming concepts or another programming language will help, but is not required to understand the material. Alhough each programming language is different (though not as different as their designers would like us to believe), they can be related along some dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low-level versus high-level** refers to whether we program using instructions and data objects at the level of the machine (something like move 64 bits of data from this location to another location) or whether we program using more abstract high level operations (like pop a menu on the screen) that have been provided by the language designer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **General versus targeted to an application domain** refers to whether the primitive operations of the programming language are widely applicable or are fine-tuned to a specific domain or machine. For example, `SQL` is designed for extracting information from relational databases, but you would'nt want to use it to build an operating system. SQL would be useless for that!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpreted versus compiled** refers to whether the sequence of instructions written by the programmer, called **source code**, is executed directly by a program called the `interpreter` that reads the code line by line and performs the specified action with code within the interpreter or whether it is first converted (by a `compiler`) into a sequence of machine-level primitive operations. There are adantages to both approaches. It is often easier to debug programs written in languages that are desgined to be interpreted, because then the interpreter can produce error messages that are easy to relate to the source code. \n",

    "Programming can dramatically improve our ability to collect and analyze information about the world, which in turn can lead to discoveries. In data science, the purpose of writing a program is to instruct a computer to carry out the steps of an analysis. Computers cannot study the world on their own, people must describe precisely what steps the computer should take in order to collect and analyze data, and those steps are expressed through programs.

    "One of the most basic feature of Python is that it is a [**Object-oriented programming language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), which means everything inside Python is an **object**. When we write programs, we essentially specify a set of actions to perform that manipuates the **object** in some capacity. Sometimes we even call the object as `value`, and each value is a piece of data that a computer program works with such as a number or text. There are different **types** of values: 42 is an integer and \"Hello!\" is a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **variable** is a just name that refers to a value, it gives us a way to associate names with objects. In mathematics and statistics, we usually use variable names like $x$ and $y$. In Python, we can use any word as a variable name as long as it starts with a letter or an underscore. However, it should not be a [reserved word](https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) in Python such as `for`, `while`, `class`, `lambda`, etc. as these words encode special functionality in Python that we don't want to overwrite!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we mentioned that a variable is just a name, its not that simple. Programming languages let us describe computations so that computers can execute them, but this does not mean only computers have to read programs. It's often best to write programs that are easy to read and an apt choice of variable names plays an important role in enhancing readability. You can read more about them [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-scientists-your-variable-names-are-awful-heres-how-to-fix-them-89053d2855be).\n",

    "We can see that even though there are 12 lines of code the computer performs the execution of code in 8 steps. In the first step it assigns the values to the variables we specified, and then changes the value of $x$ based on the condition we specified in the second line of code. We can see how the computer jumps straight to the else code block when it encounters that the `if` condition is found to be false. It then prints the output and comes out of the entire `if...else` code block and moves on to line 12.\n",

The only time the actual value of the variable changes is when we specify them explicity (which we do in code line 13).\n",
