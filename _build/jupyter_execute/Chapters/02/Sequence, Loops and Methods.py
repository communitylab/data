# 2. Sequence, Loops and Methods
<hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:#666;background-color:#666;" />

In this section we will look at another type of data called *Sequence Type*, which is a collection of data values. `str`, `list` and `tuple` are examples of sequence types. They are specific kind of [iterable](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Iterables.html)- an object that can be "iterated over" using loops, allowing us to ask the type to give each of its items in turn. 


## In this section we will:
- Learn about basic string operations and methods
- explain the difference between mutable objects like a list and immutable objects like tuple
- write for and while loops
