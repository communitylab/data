    "Much of data anlysis involves working with data contained in rectangular form in tables or csv files. In python we call these data tables as `DataFrames`, they are one of the most common and useful forms of data for analysis. We introduce data manipulation using `pandas`, the standard Python library for working with dataframes. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is more important that you understand the types of useful operations on data than the exact details of `pandas` syntax. For example, knowing when to perform a group-by is generally more useful than knowing how to call the `pandas` function to group data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we will cover only the most commonly used `pandas` functions in this tutorial, you should bookmark the [`pandas` documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) for reference\n",
    "when you conduct your own data analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by talking about the types of dataset structures that `pandas` can read. Then, we introduce indexes, grouping, apply, and strings.\n",
